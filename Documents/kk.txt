The application of complex network models to communication systems has led to several important results: nonetheless, previous research has often neglected to take into account their temporal properties, which in many real scenarios play a pivotal role.
 At the same time, network robustness has come extensively under
 scrutiny. Understanding whether networked systems can undergo structural damage and
 yet perform efficiently is crucial to both their protection against failures and to 
the design of new applications. In spite of this, it is still unclear what type of
 resilience we may expect in a network which continuously changes over time. In this
 work we present the first attempt to define the concept of temporal network robustness:
 we describe a measure of network robustness for time-varying networks and we show how
 it performs on different classes of random models by means of analytical and numerical 
evaluation. Finally, we report a case study on a real-world scenario, an opportunistic 
vehicular system of about 500 taxicabs, highlighting the importance of time in the 
evaluation of robustness. Particularly, we show how static approximation can wrongly
 indicate high robustness of fragile networks when adopted in mobile time-varying 
networks, while a temporal approach captures more accurately the system performance.
